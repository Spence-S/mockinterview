# Mock Interview

I did a mock interview that you can see on twitch! Through [kensodevs twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/kensodev) channel. It was an experience and I am really glad I did it and learned a lot! I will paste a link later to the actual interview...

## Thoughts

I feel I did pretty poorly. I was a bundle of nerves and had between 30-50 eyes on me while I was
coding which I felt extremely aware of. I had trouble focusing. The first 27 min I basically
did nothing. I pulled it together in the last half. I was One step away from solving when my
hour ran out. It was a great experience. A more detailed write up coming on my [blog](https://spence-s.github.io/blog) soon.
